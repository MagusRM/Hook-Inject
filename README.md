IMPORTANT note: If target program runs under administrator then you should run Monitor.exe under adminitrator. And vice versa! (Both programms should be ran in the same mode (user or administrator))

Note: It is assumed that injection.dll is located in the same place with Monitor.exe.

Note: x64 Monitor .exe is compatible only with x64 Windows. Same with x86.
